= Different types of parallelism
- Hyperthreading: Two Reg-Sets per core
- Multi-Core: Multiple Cores per CPU
- Multi-Processor: Multiple CPUs per machine
- Compute-Cluster

Multiple threads can write in the same memory locations $=>$ Needs explicit synchronization.

/ Multiplexing: Interleaved execution by using context switching.

= Context switching
- Synchron: Waits for condition
  - Queues itself as waiting and gives processor free
- Asynchron: Timing
  - After a defined time, the thread should release the processor
  - Prevents a thread from permanently occupying the processor

= Multitasking (scheduling)
- Cooperative (rarely used nowadays)
  - Threads must explicitly initiate context switches at intervals
- Preemptive (nowadays standard)
  - Scheduler interrupts the running thread asynchronously via timer interrupt
  - Time sliced scheduling: Each thread has the processor for maximum time interval

= Thread states
Running, Waiting, Ready

= JVM
- Single process system
- Runs as long as threads are running (not until main() is done!), unless marked as daemon-thread
- `System.exit() / Runtime.exit()`: Uncontrolled stop of all threads
- Threads realized by `Thread`-class and `Runnable`-interface
  - `void run()` can be overridden for custom behaviour
- `thread.start()` starts a Thread, JVM calls `run()` (do not call run manually!)
- If exception is unhandled, other Threads still continue
- Just like any other application threads
- Scheduling of threads handled by the OS
- Allows setting priorities to threads $->$ still managed by OS
- The current thread can be accessed with `Thread.currentThread()`
#warn(header: [Non-deterministic], [
  Threads run without any rules, interleaved or parallel. Many JVMs execute
  System Outputs without interleaving (but not specified!).
])
```java
var t1 = new Thread(() -> { System.out.println("Hi from t1"); })
t1.setDaemon(true) // Stops running when main-thread is finished
t1.start();
```
Instead of passing a lambda to `new Thread()` we can naturally also create a
class, implement `Runnable` and pass it instead (functional interfaces).

Alternatively we can also just derive a custom class from `Thread` (not recommended).

== Join
With `t2.join()`, we can block t1 as long as t2 is running.

== Interrupts
When `t2.interrupt()` is called, the thread doesn't terminate directly. It only
stops when t2 calls `join`, `wait` or `sleep`.
