= Different types of parallelism
- Hyperthreading: Two Reg-Sets per core
- Multi-Core: Multiple Cores per CPU
- Multi-Processor: Multiple CPUs per machine
- Compute-Cluster

[Heavyweight, OS only needs process context to run a program correctly, own address space.],

Multiple threads can write in the same memory locations $=>$ Needs explicit synchronization.

/ Multiplexing: Interleaved execution by using context switching.

= Context switching
- Synchron: Waits for condition
  - Queues itself as waiting and gives processor free
- Asynchron: Timing
  - After a defined time, the thread should release the processor
  - Prevents a thread from permanently occupying the processor

= Multitasking (scheduling)
- Cooperative (rarely used nowadays)
  - Threads must explicitly initiate context switches at intervals
- Preemptive (nowadays standard)
  - Scheduler interrupts the running thread asynchronously via timer interrupt
  - Time sliced scheduling: Each thread has the processor for maximum time interval

= Thread states
Running, Waiting, Ready
